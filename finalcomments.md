# Interactivity
This was a great little project that made use of several of P5's functions in an interesting and interactive way. While it might have been nice to have the user affect the circles a bit more, this worked well given the short amount of time you had on the project.

# Code Quality
You had great comments throughout and you used P5's functions well. My only minor quibble is that you could have used functions and objects to encapsulate some things and save some typing, but, as I said, that's a minor issue here.

# Aesthetics
This is a simple project that does what it needs to do and no more. Given the short time you had to work on it, that's high praise. I would encourage you to revisit this code and work on having it do more!
